# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub! 

Hello! My name is **Kenza**, and here I'll be sharing my **AWS learning journey**!

📚 I am currently a **self-taught AWS student** and have completed the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP)**, which laid a fantastic foundation for understanding AWS services. Since then, I’ve been dedicated to helping others achieve this certification as well!

📝 I’ve created a PDF that consolidates all the services mentioned in the CCP because I know from experience that it can get overwhelming with all the resources available!
 [AWS CCP Guide](https://github.com/Kzax01/AWS-Cloud-practitioner/blob/main/AWS-%20CCP-%20Kenza%20S%20guide.pdf)

In this GitHub, I plan to share **examples of AWS architectures** inspired by real-life scenarios to solidify my knowledge and aid my preparation for the **AWS Solutions Architect - Associate** exam! 

🎯 My ultimate goal is to become an **AWS Cloud Security Engineer.**

Feel free to explore, learn, and let’s embark on this journey together!
