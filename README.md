# Welcome to My GitHub! 🎉

Here, I will share my AWS learning journey!

## 📚 Learning Structure

I will divide my content into two distinct parts:

### 1️⃣ Hands-on + Courses on Basic AWS Services
This will help in preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.

### 2️⃣ Building AWS Architectures Based on Real-Life Scenarios
This will be our preparation for the AWS Solution Architect - Associate!

📄 I've created a PDF summarizing all the AWS services that I recommend reading beforehand: [AWS CCP Guide](https://github.com/Kzax01/AWS-Cloud-practitioner/blob/main/AWS-%20CCP-%20Kenza%20S%20guide.pdf)

Feel free to explore, learn, and let's embark on this journey together! 🌟
