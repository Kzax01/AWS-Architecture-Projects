# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub! 🌟

Welcome to my GitHub where I will share my AWS learning journey!

I will divide it into two distinct parts:

## 📚 Part 1
- **Hands-on projects + courses on basic AWS services** – This will help with preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. ☁️
- **📄 I’ve created a PDF summarizing all the AWS services I recommend reading before diving in!**

## 🛠️ Part 2
- **Building AWS architectures based on real-life inspired scenarios** – This will be our preparation for the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate! 🚀
