## 🐳 Docker Fundamentals 

### What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components that combine application source code with all the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run the code in any environment.

### Key Concepts

#### 📦 Container

A container is:
- Lightweight, standalone, and executable software package
- Includes everything needed to run the application:
  - Code
  - Runtime
  - System tools
  - System libraries
  - Settings

#### 🖼️ Docker Image

A Docker image is:
- A blueprint for containers
- Read-only template with instructions
- Can be stored in registries like Docker Hub or AWS ECR

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Build an image
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .

# List images
docker images

# Run a container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-app:1.0

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop container_id

# Remove a container
docker rm container_id

# Remove an image
docker rmi image_id
```

### Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
# Base image
FROM node:14

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## ☁️ AWS Elastic Beanstalk Overview

### What is Elastic Beanstalk?

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that simplifies:
- Application deployment
- Capacity provisioning
- Load balancing
- Auto-scaling
- Health monitoring

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🚀 Auto-scaling | Automatically adjusts capacity based on traffic |
| 🛠️ Managed Platform | Handles infrastructure management |
| 📊 Health Monitoring | Built-in monitoring and metrics |
| 🔄 Rolling Updates | Zero-downtime deployments |
| 🔒 Security | Integration with AWS security features |

### Supported Platforms

- Single Docker containers
- Multi-container Docker
- Preconfigured Docker platforms
- Other platforms:
  - Java
  - .NET
  - Node.js
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Go

## 🔄 Deploying Docker on Elastic Beanstalk

### Setup Process

1. **Prepare Your Application Structure**:

```plaintext
your-app/
├── .elasticbeanstalk/
│   └── config.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── Dockerrun.aws.json
├── .gitignore
└── application-files/
```

2. **Create Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
FROM node:14 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

3. **Create Dockerrun.aws.json**:

```json
{
  "AWSEBDockerrunVersion": "1",
  "Image": {
    "Name": "your-account.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/your-app:latest",
    "Update": "true"
  },
  "Ports": [
    {
      "ContainerPort": 8080,
      "HostPort": 80
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Initialize Elastic Beanstalk application
eb init -p docker my-application

# Create environment and deploy
eb create my-environment-name

# Deploy updates
eb deploy

# Check status
eb status

# View health
eb health
```

## 🎯 Benefits & Best Practices

### Why Use Docker with Elastic Beanstalk?

#### 1. 🌟 Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Consistency | Same environment across development and production |
| Scalability | Easy horizontal scaling and load balancing |
| Cost Efficiency | Pay only for resources used |
| Simplified Management | Easy rollbacks and version control |

#### 2. 🛠️ Technical Advantages

- **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own environment
- **Version Control**: Easy tracking of application versions
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better resource utilization
- **Fast Deployment**: Quick and reliable deployments
- **Easy Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on demand

### Best Practices

#### Docker Best Practices

1. **Image Optimization**:
```dockerfile
# Use multi-stage builds
FROM node:14 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

2. **Security Guidelines**:
- Use specific base image versions
- Minimize the number of layers
- Don't store secrets in images
- Scan images for vulnerabilities

#### Elastic Beanstalk Best Practices

1. **Environment Configuration**:
```yaml
# .elasticbeanstalk/config.yml
branch-defaults:
  main:
    environment: production
    group_suffix: null
global:
  application_name: my-app
  default_region: us-west-2
  profile: eb-cli
  sc: git
```

2. **Monitoring Setup**:
- Set up CloudWatch alarms
- Configure health checks
- Enable enhanced monitoring
- Set up log streaming

### 🔍 Monitoring and Troubleshooting

#### Common Commands

```bash
# View environment health
eb health

# View logs
eb logs

# SSH into instance
eb ssh

# Check Docker container logs
docker logs container_id
```

#### Monitoring Tools Integration

```json
{
  "loglevel": "warn",
  "monitoring": {
    "enabled": true,
    "aggregationInterval": "60s"
  },
  "logging": {
    "driver": "awslogs"
  }
}
```
